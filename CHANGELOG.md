## **Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards** (*v0.5.0*)

* Updated the rule definitions to be stricter. — Now violations result in **errors**, not *warnings*.

## **Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards** (*v0.4.0*)

* Added Node.JS-specific rules that do not depend on a transpiler (like Babel).
* Dogfooding: From now on, “Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards” is linting itself as part of its CI pipeline.
* Started using yarn; meoooow!

## **Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards** (*v0.3.1*)
