## **Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards** (*v2.0.0*)

* `2.0.0` because it is a breaking change, because now the rules are being updated
  to keep [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html) happy too.

## **Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards** (*v0.9.0*)

* Minor updates for the **base** and **Node.js** rule sets.

## **Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards** (*v0.7.0*)

* Slightly changed the code to keep it compatible with the recent version of ESLint.

## **Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards** (*v0.5.0*)

* Updated the rule definitions to be stricter. — Now violations result in
  **errors**, not *warnings*.

## **Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards** (*v0.4.0*)

* Added Node.JS-specific rules that do not depend on a transpiler (like Babel).
* Dogfooding: From now on, “Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards” is linting
  itself as part of its CI pipeline.
* Started using yarn; meoooow!

## **Byte-Sized JavaScript Coding Standards** (*v0.3.1*)

* Created a README, added usage examples.
* Created this changelog.
